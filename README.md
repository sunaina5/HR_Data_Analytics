# HR_Data_Analytics

This project follows a complete end-to-end data analysis and ML workflow:

âœ… Cleaned and transformed raw HR data using SQL - 
    SQL Part:
	1.	Database design & table creation
	2.	Exploratory querying to understand attrition trends
	3.	Data cleaning & validation
	4.	Feature engineering before modeling
	5.	Translating business questions into SQL logic


âœ… Performed EDA and trained predictive models using Python


âœ… Used SHAP for feature importance and model explainability

Overall Key Insights:

â€¢	XGBoost is the most balanced model post-tuning, especially for class 1 (attrition).
â€¢	Logistic Regression and Random Forest struggle to capture class 1 well.
â€¢	If your business goal is to catch potential attrition risks, tuned XGBoost is your best pick despite a slight accuracy trade-off.
Recommendations for HR Team

Based on model insights and feature analysis:

ðŸ”¹ Monitor Overtime: Employees working overtime have the highest attrition rates. Review workload distribution and encourage better work-life balance.

ðŸ”¹ Support Low Job Satisfaction: Introduce frequent check-ins, employee engagement surveys, and career growth paths for employees reporting low satisfaction.

ðŸ”¹ Adjust Compensation Fairly: Attrition is higher among those earning < $10,000/month. Consider reviewing salary structure, especially for junior and mid-level roles.

ðŸ”¹ Target Sales & Travel-heavy Roles: High attrition observed in Sales Representatives and those who Travel Frequently. Offer flexible travel policies and incentives.

ðŸ”¹ Prioritize Single Employees: Singles showed a higher tendency to leave. Explore their job satisfaction factors and professional development interest.

Our machine learning model (XGBoost) enables HR to proactively identify high-risk employees, understand why they might leave, and take data-driven actions to reduce attrition
